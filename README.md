# Catman Mode

A fun RuneLite plugin that transforms all other players into cats! This is a client-side only visual effect - other players won't see themselves as cats.

## Features

- **Player Transformation**: All other players appear as cats on your screen
- **Combat Level Based Models**:
  - Players with combat level 80+ become adult cats
  - Players under combat level 80 become adorable kittens
- **Random Cat Colors**: Each player gets a consistent cat color based on their name (grey, white, brown, black, brown/grey, blue/grey)
- **Hellcat Variants**: Optional hellcat/hellkitten appearances
- **Cat Animations**: Player actions are mapped to appropriate cat animations:
  - Combat → Pounce
  - Magic/Skilling → Paw
  - Emotes → Roll
  - Fishing/Prayer → Sit
  - Taking damage → Arch back (scared cat!)
- **Pet Feature**: Right-click any player to pet them!
  - Cat plays a rolling animation
  - Shows "Prrr~" overhead text
  - Plays a purring sound effect
  - Your character says "What a good cat!"
